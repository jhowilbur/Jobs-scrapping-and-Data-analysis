# LinkedIn Jobs Scraping for Data Analysis (Data Wrangling and Visualization)

## Introduction
This project was born out of curiosity. 
Being new to data analysis, I was perplexed about received opinions propagated by the old ones. 
I thought, why not check all this out?


The steps are simple: collect, clean and analyze data.

### Collect Data
I chose LinkedIn as the job listing platform to scrape. 
To do so, we wrote a python script to go through LinkedIn and collected all the necessary data. 
After a poll, 3 locations were chosen: Africa, Canada, and the USA.

### Clean Data
To make the data ready for analysis, we use python and its libraries.

### How to use
- Clone the repository
- Install the requirements
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Run the script
```python
python linkedin_scraper.py
```
- Open the notebook
